# Pedraza & Wilcox-Archuleta MC

These are the precinct level returns used to generate results. All results are unofficial. 

The EI replication data are separate. This only contains 2016 data we were able to merge and obtain precinct level demographics. 

The other data were used to make the charts and contain 2016 and 2012 results that we were able to match and add demographics.
