These are the precinct level returns used to generate results for the Monkey Cage post. 

The 2016 data are used to make most of the plots and run the EI analysis. 

+ Precinct level election returns were gathered from individual counties in Texas. 

+ Results were merged with precinct level demographics obtained from the Legislative Council Services redistricting file: http://www.tlc.state.tx.us/redist/data/data.html 

+ Weights were obtained as the proportion of voters in each precinct over the total number of voters in the county. 

+ Kings's EI is available here: http://gking.harvard.edu/eiR

The 2012_2016 data are used to make the Obama-Clinton comparison. 

+ The process was largely similar as explained above. 2012 vote returns were obtained here: ftp://ftpgis1.tlc.state.tx.us/elections/2012_General_Election_Returns.csv

+  Precincts that changed between 2012 and 2016 were dropped from analysis.
